            In this section we sketch the guidelines that we try to stick to
            when we create presentations. These guidelines either arise out of
            experience, out of common sense, or out of recommendations by other
            people or books. These rules are certainly not intended as
            commandments that, if not followed, will result in catastrophe. The
            central rule of typography also applies to creating presentations:
            <em>Every rule can be broken, but no rule may be ignored.</em>

            When you start to create a presentation, the very first thing you
            should worry about is the amount of time you have for your
            presentation. Depending on the occasion, this can be anything
            between 2 minutes and two hours.
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; A simple rule for the number of frames is that you should
                have at most one frame per minute.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; In most situations, you will have less time for your
                presentation than you would like.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull;
                <em
                  >Do not try to squeeze more into a presentation than time
                  allows for.</em
                >
                No matter how important some detail seems to you, it is better
                to leave it out, but get the main message across, than getting
                neither the main message nor the detail across.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In many situations, a quick appraisal of how much time you have will
            show that you won&rsquo;t be able to mention certain details.
            Knowing this can save you hours of work on preparing slides that you
            would have to remove later anyway.

          <p>
            To create the &ldquo;global structure&rdquo; of a presentation, with
            the time constraints in mind, proceed as follows:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Make a mental inventory of the things you can reasonably
                talk about within the time available.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Categorize the inventory into sections and subsections.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; For very long talks (like a 90 minute lecture), you might
                also divide your talk into independent parts (like a
                &ldquo;review of the previous lecture part&rdquo; and a
                &ldquo;main part&rdquo;) using the
                <span class="texttt">\part</span> command. Note that each part
                has its own table of contents.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Do not feel afraid to change the structure later on as
                you work on the talk.

            <li>

                &bull; Do not use more than four sections and not less than two
                per part.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Even four sections are usually too much, unless they follow a very
            easy pattern. Five and more sections are simply too hard to remember
            for the audience. After all, when you present the table of contents,
            the audience will not yet really be able to grasp the importance and
            relevance of the different sections and will most likely have
            forgotten them by the time you reach them.

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Ideally, a table of contents should be understandable by
                itself. In particular, it should be comprehensible
                <em>before</em> someone has heard your talk.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Both the sections and the subsections should follow a
                logical pattern.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Begin with an explanation of what your talk is all about.
                (Do not assume that everyone knows this. The
                <em>Ignorant Audience Law</em> states: Someone important in the
                audience always knows less than you think everyone should know,
                even if you take the Ignorant Audience Law into account.)

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Then explain what you or someone else has found out
                concerning the subject matter.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Always conclude your talk with a summary that repeats the
                main message of the talk in a short and simple way. People pay
                most attention at the beginning and at the end of talks. The
                summary is your &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; to get across a
                message.

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; You can also add an appendix part using the
                <span class="texttt">\appendix</span> command. Put everything
                into this part that you do not actually intend to talk about,
                but that might come in handy when questions are asked.

            In papers, the abstract gives a short summary of the whole paper in

            A common way of globally structuring (math) articles and books is to
            use consecutively numbered definitions and theorems. Unfortunately,
            for presentations the situation is a bit more complicated and we
            would like to discourage using numbered theorems in presentations.
            The audience has no chance of remembering these numbers.
            <em>Never</em> say things like &ldquo;now, by Theorem&nbsp;2.5 that
            I showed you earlier, we have &hellip;&rdquo; It would be much
            better to refer to, say, Kummer&rsquo;s Theorem instead of
            Theorem&nbsp;2.5. If Theorem&nbsp;2.5 is some obscure theorem that
            does not have its own name (unlike Kummer&rsquo;s Theorem or Main
            Theorem or Second Main Theorem or Key Lemma), then the audience will
            have forgotten about it anyway by the time you refer to it again.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our opinion, the only situation in which numbered theorems make
            sense in a presentation is in a lecture, in which the students can
            read lecture notes in parallel to the lecture where the theorems are
            numbered in exactly the same way.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do number theorems and definitions, number everything
            consecutively. Thus if there are one theorem, one lemma, and one
            definition, you would have Theorem&nbsp;1, Lemma&nbsp;2, and
            Definition&nbsp;3. Some people prefer all three to be
            numbered&nbsp;1. We would <em>strongly</em> like to discourage this.
            The problem is that this makes it virtually impossible to find
            anything since Theorem&nbsp;2 might come after Definition&nbsp;10 or
            the other way round. Papers and, worse, books that have a
            Theorem&nbsp;1 and a Definition&nbsp;1 are a pain.

            You may also wish to present a bibliography at the end of your talk,
            so that people can see what kind of &ldquo;further reading&rdquo; is
            possible. When adding a bibliography to a presentation, keep the
            following in mind:

                &bull; It is a bad idea to present a long bibliography in a
                presentation. Present only very few references. (Naturally, this
                applies only to the talk itself, not to a possible handout.)

              <p>

                be confusing since the audience has little chance of remembering
                the citations. If you cite the references, always cite them with
                full author name and year like &ldquo;[Tantau, 2003]&rdquo;
                instead of something like &ldquo;[2,4]&rdquo; or

                this can be confusing for the audience since it is often not
                immediately clear who exactly &ldquo;T.&rdquo; might be. We
                recommend using the full name.

            Just like your whole presentation, each frame should also be
            structured. A frame that is solely filled with some long text is
            very hard to follow. It is your job to structure the contents of
            each frame such that, ideally, the audience immediately sees which
            information is important, which information is just a detail, how
            the presented information is related, and so on.

                Poset&rdquo; will have everyone puzzled what this slide might be
                about. Titles like &ldquo;Review of the Definition of Partially
                Ordered Sets (Posets)&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Partial Ordering on the
                Columns of the Genotype Matrix&rdquo; are <em>much</em> more

                <em>or</em> you <em>always</em> use the normal lowercase
                letters. Do <em>not</em> mix this; stick to one rule. The same
                is true for block titles. For example, do not use titles like
                &ldquo;A short Review of Turing machines.&rdquo; Either use
                &ldquo;A Short Review of Turing Machines.&rdquo; or &ldquo;A

            Ideally, during a presentation you would like to present your slides
            in a perfectly linear fashion, presumably by pressing the
            page-down-key once for each slide. However, there are different
            reasons why you might have to deviate from this linear order:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Your presentation may contain &ldquo;different levels of
                detail&rdquo; that may or may not be skipped or expanded,
                depending on the audience&rsquo;s reaction.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; You are asked questions and wish to show supplementary
                slides.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; You present a complicated picture and you have to
                &ldquo;zoom out&rdquo; different parts to explain details.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; You are asked questions about an earlier slide, which
                forces you to find and then jump to that slide.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You cannot really prepare against the last kind of questions. In
            this case, you can use the navigation bars and symbols to find the
            slide you are interested in, see
            <a href="Creating-Frames.html#section-navigation-bars">8.2.3</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Concerning the first three kinds of deviations, there are several
            things you can do to prepare &ldquo;planned detours&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;planned short cuts&rdquo;.
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; You can add &ldquo;skip buttons.&rdquo; When such a
                button is pressed, you jump over a well-defined part of your
                talk. Skip button have two advantages over just pressing the
                forward key is rapid succession: first, you immediately end up
                at the correct position and, second, the button&rsquo;s label
                can give the audience a visual feedback of what exactly will be
                skipped. For example, when you press a skip button labeled
                &ldquo;Skip proof&rdquo; nobody will start puzzling over what he
                or she has missed.

                &bull; You can add an appendix to your talk. The appendix is
                kept &ldquo;perfectly separated&rdquo; from the main talk. Only
                once you &ldquo;enter&rdquo; the appendix part (presumably by
                hyperjumping into it), does the appendix structure become
                visible. You can put all frames that you do not intend to show
                during the normal course of your talk, but which you would like
                to have handy in case someone asks, into this appendix.

                jump to a certain part of the presentation where extra details
                can be shown. In this part, there is a return button present on
                each slide that will jump back to the place where the goto
                button was pressed.

                can use the <span class="texttt">\againframe</span> command at a
                much later point, for example only in the appendix to show

            Graphics often convey concepts or ideas much more efficiently than
            text: A picture can say more than a thousand words. (Although,
            sometimes a word can say more than a thousand pictures.)

              <p>
                &bull; Put (at least) one graphic on each slide, whenever
                possible. Visualizations help an audience enormously.

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Usually, place graphics to the left of the text. (Use the
                <span class="texttt">columns</span> environment.) In a
                left-to-right reading culture, we look at the left first.

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Graphics should have the same typographic parameters as
                the text: Use the same fonts (at the same size) in graphics as
                in the main text. A small dot in a graphic should have exactly
                the same size as a small dot in a text. The line width should be
                the same as the stroke width used in creating the glyphs of the
                font. For example, an 11pt non-bold Computer Modern font has a
                stroke width of 0.4pt.

                &bull; While bitmap graphics, like photos, can be much more
                colorful than the rest of the text, vector graphics should
                follow the same &ldquo;color logic&rdquo; as the main text (like
                black&nbsp;= normal lines, red&nbsp;= highlighted parts,
                green&nbsp;= examples, blue&nbsp;= structure).

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Like text, you should explain everything that is shown on
                a graphic. Unexplained details make the audience puzzle whether
                this was something important that they have missed. Be careful
                when importing graphics from a paper or some other source. They
                usually have much more detail than you will be able to explain
                and should be radically simplified.

              <p>
                &bull; Sometimes the complexity of a graphic is intentional and
                you are willing to spend much time explaining the graphic in
                great detail. In this case, you will often run into the problem
                that fine details of the graphic are hard to discern for the
                audience. In this case you should use a command like
                <span class="texttt">\framezoom</span> to create anticipated
                zoomings of interesting parts of the graphic, see

                case, the dissolving gives the audience visual feedback that the
                young boy &ldquo;slowly becomes&rdquo; the man.

                &bull; A longer talk is more likely to require navigational
                hints than a short one. When you give a 90 minute lecture to
                students, you should choose a theme that always shows a sidebar
                with the current topic highlighted so that everyone always knows
                exactly what&rsquo;s the current &ldquo;status&rdquo; of your
                talk is; when you give a ten-minute introductory speech, a table

                having your name on each slide is just vanity.

                like <span class="texttt">Berkeley</span> will look much less

            Text and fonts literally surround us constantly. Try to think of the
            last time when there was no text around you within ten meters.
            Likely, this has never happened in your life! (Whenever you wear
            clothing, even a swim suit, there is a lot of text right next to
            your body.) The history of fonts is nearly as long as the history of
            civilization itself. There are tens of thousands of fonts available
            these days, some of which are the product of hundreds of years of
            optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choosing the right fonts for a presentation is by no means trivial
            and wrong choices will either just &ldquo;look bad&rdquo; or, worse,
            make the audience have trouble reading your slides. This
            user&rsquo;s guide cannot replace a good book on typography, but in
            the present section you&rsquo;ll find several hints that should help
            you setup fonts for a
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            presentation that look good. A font has numerous attributes like
            weight, family, or size. All of these have an impact on the
            usability of the font in presentations. In the following, these
            attributes are described and advantages and disadvantages of the
            different choices are sketched.

          <p>
            Perhaps the most obvious attribute of a font is its size. Fonts are
            traditionally measured in &ldquo;points.&rdquo; How much a point is
            depends on whom you ask.
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            thinks a point is the 72.27th part of an inch, which is 2.54 cm. On
            the other hand, PostScript and Adobe think a point is the 72th part
            of an inch (<span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            calls this a big point). There are differences between American and
            European points. Once it is settled how much a point is, claiming
            that a text is in &ldquo;11pt&rdquo; means that the
            &ldquo;height&rdquo; of the letters in the font are 11pt. However,
            this &ldquo;height&rdquo; stems from the time when letters where
            still cast in lead and refers to the vertical size of the lead
            letters. It thus does not need to have any correlation with the
            actual height of, say, the letter x or even the letter M. The letter
            x of an 11pt Times from Adobe will have a height that is different
            from the height of the letter x of an 11pt Times from UTC and the
            letter x of an 11pt Helvetica from Adobe will have yet another
            height.
          </p>
          <p>
            Summing up, the font size has little to do with the actual size of
            letters. Rather, these days it is a convention that 10pt or 11pt is
            the size a font should be printed for &ldquo;normal reading.&rdquo;
            Fonts are designed so that they can optimally be read at these
            sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a presentation the classical font sizes obviously lose their
            meaning. Nobody could read a projected text if it were actually
            11pt. Instead, the projected letters need to be several centimetres
            high. Thus, it does not really make sense to specify &ldquo;font
            sizes&rdquo; for presentations in the usual way. Instead, you should
            try to think of the number of lines that will fit on a slide if you
            were to fill the whole slide with line-by-line text (you are never
            going to do that in practice, though). Depending on how far your
            audience is removed from the projection and on how large the
            projection is, between 10 and 20 lines should fit on each slide. The
            less lines, the more readable your text will be.
          </p>
          <p>
            In
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >, the default sizes of the fonts are chosen in a way that makes it
            difficult to fit &ldquo;too much&rdquo; onto a slide. Also, it will
            ensure that your slides are readable even under bad conditions like
            a large room and only a small projection area. However, you may wish
            to enlarge or shrink the fonts a bit if you know this to be more
            appropriate in your presentation environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the size of the normal text is settled, all other sizes are
            usually defined relative to that size. For this reason,
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"
                  >e</span
                >X</span
              ></span
            >
            has commands like <span class="texttt">\large</span> or
            <span class="texttt">\small</span>. The actual size these commands
            select depends on the size of normal text.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a presentation, you will want to use a very small font for text
            in headlines, footlines, or sidebars since the text shown there is
            not vital and is read at the audience&rsquo;s leisure. Naturally,
            the text should still be large enough that it actually
            <em>can</em> be read without binoculars. However, in a normal
            presentation environment the audience will still be able to read
            even <span class="texttt">\tiny</span> text when necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, using small fonts can be tricky. Many PostScript fonts are
            just scaled down when used at small sizes. When a font is used at
            less than its normal size, the characters should actually be stroked
            using a slightly thicker &ldquo;pen&rdquo; than the one resulting
            from just scaling things. For this reason, high quality multiple
            master fonts or the Computer Modern fonts use different fonts for
            small characters and for normal characters. However, when you use a
            normal Helvetica or Times font, the characters are just scaled down.
            A similar problem arises when you use a light font on a dark
            background. Even when printed on paper in high resolution,
            light-on-dark text tends to be &ldquo;overflooded&rdquo; by the dark
            background. When light-on-dark text is rendered in a presentation
            this effect can be much worse, making the text almost impossible to
            read.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can counter both negative effects by using a bold version for
            small text.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the other direction, you can use larger text for titles. However,
            using a larger font does not always have the desired effect. Just
            because a frame title is printed in large letters does not mean that
            it is read first. Indeed, have a look at the cover of your favorite
            magazine. Most likely, the magazine&rsquo;s name is the typeset in
            the largest font, but your attention will nevertheless first go to
            the topics advertised on the cover. Likewise, in the table of
            contents you are likely to first focus on the entries, not on the
            words &ldquo;Table of Contents.&rdquo; Most likely, you would not
            spot a spelling mistake there (a friend of mine actually managed to
            misspell <em>his own name</em> on the cover of his master&rsquo;s
            thesis and nobody noticed until a year later). In essence, large
            text at the top of a page signals &ldquo;unimportant since I know
            what to expect.&rdquo; So, instead of using a very large frame
            title, also consider using a normal size frame title that is typeset
            in bold or in italics.

          <p>
            The other central property of any font is its family. Examples of
            font families are Times or Helvetica or Futura. As the name
            suggests, a lot of different fonts can belong to the same family.
            For example, Times comes in different sizes, there is a bold version
            of Times, an italics version, and so on. To confuse matters, font
            families like Times are often just called the &ldquo;font
            Times.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two large classes of font families: serif fonts and
            sans-serif fonts. A sans-serif font is a font in which the letters
            do not have serifs (from French <em>sans</em>, which means
            &ldquo;without&rdquo;). Serifs are the little hooks at the ending of
            the strokes that make up a letter. The font you are currently
            reading is a serif font.
            <span class="textsf"
              >By comparison, this text is in a sans-serif font.</span
            >
            Sans-serif fonts are (generally considered to be) easier to read
            when used in a presentation. In low resolution rendering, serifs
            decrease the legibility of a font. However, on projectors with very
            high resolution serif text is just as readable as sans-serif text. A
            presentation typeset in a serif font creates a more conservative
            impression, which might be exactly what you wish to create.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most likely, you&rsquo;ll have a lot of different font families
            preinstalled on your system. The default font used by
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            (and
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >) is the Computer Modern font. It is the original font family
            designed by Donald Knuth himself for the
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            program. It is a mature font that comes with just about everything
            you could wish for: extensive mathematical alphabets, outline
            PostScript versions, real small caps, real oldstyle numbers,
            specially designed small and large letters, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are reasons for using font families other than
            Computer Modern:

            <li>

                &bull; The Computer Modern fonts are a bit boring if you have
                seen them too often. Using another font (but not Times!) can
                give a fresh look.

                &bull; The sans-serif version of Computer Modern is not nearly
                as well-designed as the serif version. Indeed, the sans-serif
                version is, in essence, the serif version with different design
                parameters, not an independent design.

                &bull; Computer modern needs much more space than more economic
                fonts like Times (this explains why Times is so popular with
                people who need to squeeze their great paper into just twelve
                pages). To be fair, Times was specifically designed to be
                economic (the newspaper company publishing The Times needed
                robust, but space-economic font).

          <p>A small selection of alternatives to Computer Modern:</p>

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Latin Modern is a Computer Modern derivative that
                provides more characters, so it&rsquo;s not considered a real
                alternative. It&rsquo;s recommended over Computer Modern,
                though.

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Helvetica is an often used alternative. However,
                Helvetica also tends to look boring (since we see it everywhere)
                and it has a very large x-height (the height of the
                letter&nbsp;x in comparison to a letter like&nbsp;M). A large
                x-height is usually considered good for languages (like English)
                that use uppercase letters seldom and not-so-good for languages
                (like German) that use uppercase letters a lot. (We have never
                been quite convinced by the argument for this, though.) Be
                warned: the x-height of Helvetica is so different from the
                x-height of Times that mixing the two in a single line looks
                strange. The packages for loading Times and Helvetica provide
                options for fixing this, though.

                &bull; Futura is, in our opinion, a beautiful font that is very
                well-suited for presentations. Its thick letters make it robust
                against scaling, inversion, and low contrast. Unfortunately,
                while it is most likely installed on your system somewhere in
                some form, getting

                made a lot simpler with modern typesetting engines such as

                &bull; Times is a possible alternative to Computer Modern. Its
                main disadvantage is that it is a serif font, which requires a
                high-resolution projector. Naturally, it also used very often,
                so we all know it very well.

            There is one popular font that is a bit special: Microsoft&rsquo;s
            Comic Sans. On the one hand, there is a website lobbying for banning
            the use of this font. Indeed, the main trouble with the font is that
            it is not particularly well-readable and that math typeset partly
            using this font looks terrible. On the other hand, this font
            <em>does</em> create the impression of a slide &ldquo;written by
            hand,&rdquo; which gives the presentation a natural look. Think
            twice before using this font, but do not let yourself be
            intimidated.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most important rules of typography is that you should use
            as little fonts as possible in a text. In particular, typographic
            wisdom dictates that you should not use more than two different
            families on one page. However, when typesetting mathematical text,
            it is often necessary and useful to use different font families. For
            example, it used to be common practice to use Gothic letters to
            denote vectors. Also, program texts are often typeset in monospace
            fonts. If your audience is used to a certain font family for a
            certain type of text, use that family, regardless of what
            typographic wisdom says.
          </p>
          <p>
            A common practice in typography is to use a sans-serif fonts for
            titles and serif fonts for normal text (check your favorite
            magazine). You can <em>also</em> use two different sans-serif fonts
            or two different serif fonts, but you then have to make sure that
            the fonts look &ldquo;sufficiently different.&rdquo; If they look
            only slightly different, the page will look &ldquo;somehow
            strange,&rdquo; but the audience will not be able to tell why. For
            example, do not mix Arial and Helvetica (they are almost identical)
            or Computer Modern and Baskerville (they are quite similar). A
            combination of Gills Sans and Helvetica is dangerous but perhaps
            possible. A combination like Futura and Optima is certainly OK, at
            least with respect to the fonts being very different.

            introduces the concept of the <em>shape</em> of a font. The only
            really important ones are italic and small caps. An
            <em>italic</em> font is a font in which the text is slightly slanted
            to the right <em>like this</em>. Things to know about italics:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Italics are commonly used in novels to express emphasis.
                However, especially with sans-serif fonts, italics are typically
                not &ldquo;strong enough&rdquo; and the emphasis gets lost in a
                presentation. Using a different color or bold text seems better
                suited for presentations to create emphasis.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; If you look closely, you will notice that italic text is
                not only slanted but that different letters are actually used
                (compare a and <em>a</em>, for example). However, this is only
                true for serif text, not for sans-serif text. Text that is only
                slanted without using different characters is called
                &ldquo;slanted&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;italic.&rdquo;
                Sometimes, the word &ldquo;oblique&rdquo; is also used for
                slanted, but it sometimes also used for italics, so it is
                perhaps best to avoid it. Using slanted serif text is very much
                frowned upon by typographers and is considered &ldquo;cheap
                computer typography.&rdquo; However, people who use slanted text
                in their books include Donald Knuth.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a presentation, if you go to the trouble of using a serif
                font for some part of it, you should also use italics, not
                slanted text.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The different characters used for serif italics have
                changed much less from the original handwritten letters they are
                based on than normal serif text. For this reason, serif italics
                creates the impression of handwritten text, which may be
                desirable to give a presentation a more &ldquo;personal
                touch&rdquo; (although you can&rsquo;t get very personal using
                Times italics, which everyone has seen a thousand times).
                However, it is harder to read than normal text, so do not use it
                for text more than a line long.

            are small capital letters. Using them can create a conservative,
            even formal impression, but some words of caution:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Small capitals are different from all-uppercase text. A
                small caps text leaves normal uppercase letters unchanged and
                uses smaller versions of the uppercase letters for normal
                typesetting lowercase letters. Thus the word
                &ldquo;German&rdquo; is typeset as
                <span class="textsc">German</span> using small caps, but as
                GERMAN using all uppercase letters.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Small caps either come as &ldquo;faked&rdquo; small caps
                or as &ldquo;real&rdquo; small caps. Faked small caps are
                created by just scaling down normal uppercase letters. This
                leads to letters the look too thin. Real small caps are
                specially designed smaller versions of the uppercase letters
                that have the same stroke width as normal text.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Computer Modern fonts and expert version of PostScript
                fonts come with real small caps (though the small caps of
                Computer Modern are one point size too large for some
                unfathomable reason&mdash;but your audience is going to pardon
                this since it will not be noticed anyway). &ldquo;Simple&rdquo;
                PostScript fonts like out-of-the-box Helvetica or Times only
                come with faked small caps.

            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Text typeset in small caps is harder to read than normal
                text. The reason is that we read by seeing the
                &ldquo;shape&rdquo; of words. For example, the word
                &ldquo;shape&rdquo; is mainly recognized by seeing one normal
                letter, one ascending letter, a normal letter, one descending
                letter, and a normal letter. One has much more trouble spotting
                a misspelling like &ldquo;shepe&rdquo; than &ldquo;spape&rdquo;.
                Small caps destroy the shape of words since
                <span class="textsc">shape</span>,
                <span class="textsc">shepe</span> and
                <span class="textsc">spape</span> all have the same shape, thus
                making it much harder to tell them apart. Your audience will
                read small caps more slowly than normal text. This is, by the
                way, why legal disclaimers are often written in uppercase
                letters: not to make them appear more important to you, but to
                make them much harder to actually read.

            The &ldquo;weight&rdquo; of a font refers to the thickness of the
            letters. Usually, fonts come as regular or as bold fonts. There
            often also exist semibold, ultrabold (or black), thin, or ultrathin
            (or hair) versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In typography, using a bold font to create emphasis, especially
            within normal text, is frowned upon (bold words in the middle of a
            normal text are referred to as &ldquo;dirt&rdquo;). For
            presentations this rule of not using bold text does not really
            apply. On a presentation slide there is usually very little text and
            there are numerous elements that try to attract the viewer&rsquo;s
            attention. Using the traditional italics to create emphasis will
            often be overlooked. So, using bold text, seems a good alternative
            in a presentation. However, an even better alternative is using a
            bright color like red to attract attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            As pointed out earlier, you should use bold text for small text
            unless you use an especially robust font like Futura or DejaVu.
