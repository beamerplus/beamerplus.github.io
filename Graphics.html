            There are two principal ways of creating

              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >-documents that include graphics: Either the graphic resides in an
            external file that is <em>included</em> or the graphic is
            <em>inlined</em>, which means that
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >-file contains a bunch of commands like &ldquo;draw a red line from
            here to there.&rdquo; In the following, the advantages and
            disadvantages of these two approaches are discussed.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use an external program, like
            <span class="texttt">xfig</span>, GIMP or Inkscape, to create a
            graphic. These programs have an option to <em>export</em> graphic
            files in a format that can then be inserted into the presentation.
          </p>
          <p>The main advantage is:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; You can use a powerful program to create a high-quality
                graphic.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The main disadvantages are:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; You have to worry about many files. Typically there are
                at least two for each presentation, namely the program&rsquo;s
                graphic data file and the exported graphic file in a format that
                can be read by
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
                  ></span
                >.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Changing the graphic using the program does not
                automatically change the graphic in the presentation. Rather,
                you must reexport the graphic and rerun
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span
                      class="latexlogosub"
                      >e</span
                    >X</span
                  ></span
                >.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; It may be difficult to get the line width, fonts, and
                font sizes right.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Creating formulas as part of graphics is often difficult
                or impossible.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can use all the standard
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"
                  >e</span
                >X</span
              ></span
            >
            commands for inserting graphics, like
            <span class="texttt">\includegraphics</span>. Also, the
            <span class="texttt">pgf</span> package offers commands for
            including graphics. Either will work fine in most situations, so
            choose whichever you like. Like
            <span class="texttt">\pgfdeclareimage</span>,
            <span class="texttt">\includegraphics</span> also includes an image
            only once in a <span class="texttt">.pdf</span> file, even if it
            used several times (as a matter of fact, the
            <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package is even a bit smarter
            about this than <span class="texttt">pgf</span>). However, currently
            only <span class="texttt">pgf</span> offers the ability to include
            images that are partly transparent.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of this section you will find notes on how to include
            specific graphic formats like <span class="texttt">.eps</span> or
            <span class="texttt">.jpg</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The commands <span class="texttt">\includegraphics</span>,
            <span class="texttt">\pgfuseimage</span>, and
            <span class="texttt">\pgfimage</span> are
            overlay-specification-aware in
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >. If the overlay specification does not apply, the command has no
            effect. This is useful for creating a simple animation where each
            picture of the animation resides in a different file:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\begin{frame}
  \includegraphics&lt;1&gt;[height=2cm]{step1.pdf}%
  \includegraphics&lt;2&gt;[height=2cm]{step2.pdf}%
  \includegraphics&lt;3&gt;[height=2cm]{step3.pdf}%
\end{frame}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            A different way of creating graphics is to insert graphic drawing
            commands directly into your
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"
                  >e</span
                >X</span
              ></span
            >
            file. There are numerous packages that help you do this. They have
            various degrees of sophistication. Inlining graphics suffers from
            none of the disadvantages mentioned above for including external
            graphic files, but the main disadvantage is that it is often hard to
            use these packages. In some sense, you &ldquo;program&rdquo; your
            graphics, which requires a bit of practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            When choosing a graphic package, there are a few things to keep in
            mind:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Many packages produce poor quality graphics. This is
                especially true of the standard
                <span class="texttt">picture</span> environment of
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span
                      class="latexlogosub"
                      >e</span
                    >X</span
                  ></span
                >.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; Powerful packages that produce high-quality graphics
                often do not work together with
                <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>,
                <span class="texttt">lualatex</span> or
                <span class="texttt">xelatex</span>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &bull; The most powerful and easiest-to-use package around,
                namely <span class="texttt">pstricks</span>, does not work
                together with <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>,
                <span class="texttt">lualatex</span> or
                <span class="texttt">xelatex</span> and this is a fundamental
                problem. Due to the fundamental differences between
                <span class="pgf-name"><span class="textsc">pdf</span></span>
                and PostScript, it is not possible to write a &ldquo;<span
                  class="texttt"
                  >pdflatex</span
                >
                back-end for <span class="texttt">pstricks</span>.&rdquo;
                (Situation with <span class="texttt">lualatex</span> and
                <span class="texttt">xelatex</span> is very similar.)
                Regardless, <span class="textsc">pst-pdf</span>,
                <span class="textsc">xetex-pstricks</span> and
                <span class="textsc">pdftricks</span> package can help here and
                simplify things from user&rsquo;s perspective.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are three possible solutions to the above problem, each with
            it&rsquo;s own advantages and disadvantages.

                <span class="texttt">latex</span>. It is not as powerful as
                <span class="texttt">pstricks</span> (as pointed out above, this
                is because of rather fundamental reasons) and not as easy to
                use, but it should be sufficient in most cases.

            External graphic files ending with the extension
            <span class="texttt">.eps</span> (Encapsulated PostScript) or
            <span class="texttt">.ps</span> (PostScript) can be included if you
            use <span class="texttt">latex</span> and
            <span class="texttt">dvips</span>, but <em>not</em> when using
            <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>. This is true both for the
            normal <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package and for
            <span class="texttt">pgf</span>. When using
            <span class="texttt">pgf</span>, do <em>not</em> add the extension
            <span class="texttt">.eps</span>. When using
            <span class="texttt">graphics</span>, do add the extension.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a <span class="texttt">.eps</span> graphic and wish to
            use <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>, you can use the program
            <span class="texttt">ps2pdf</span> to convert the graphic to a
            <span class="texttt">.pdf</span> file. Some modern distributions
            enable <span class="texttt">write18</span> which allows
            <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span> to do that automatically. Note,
            however, that it is often a better idea to directly generate a
            <span class="texttt">.pdf</span> if the program that produced the
            <span class="texttt">.eps</span> supports this.

          <p>
            A graphic file ending <span class="texttt">.mps</span> (MetaPost
            PostScript) is a special kind of Encapsulated PostScript file. Files
            in this format are produced by the MetaPost program. As you know,
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >
            is a program that converts simple plain text into beautifully
            typeset documents. The MetaPost program is similar, only it converts
            simple plain text into beautiful graphics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MetaPost program converts a plain text file ending
            <span class="texttt">.mp</span> into an
            <span class="texttt">.mps</span> file (although for some
            unfathomable reason the extension is not added). The
            <span class="texttt">.mp</span> file must contain text written in
            the MetaFont programming language. Since
            <span class="texttt">.mps</span> files are actually also
            <span class="texttt">.eps</span> files, you can use the normal
            <span class="texttt">\includegraphics</span> command to include
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as a special bonus, you can <em>also</em> include such a
            file when using <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>. Normally,
            <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span> cannot handle
            <span class="texttt">.eps</span> files, but the
            <span class="texttt">.mps</span> files produced by MetaPost have
            such a simple and special structure that this is possible. The
            <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package implements some filters
            to convert such PostScript output to
            <span class="pgf-name"><span class="textsc">pdf</span></span>
            on-the-fly. For this to work, the file should end
            <span class="texttt">.mps</span> instead of
            <span class="texttt">.eps</span>. The following command can be used
            to make the <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package just
            <em>assume</em> the extension <span class="texttt">.mps</span> for
            any file it knows nothing about (like files ending with
            <span class="texttt">.1</span>, which is what MetaPost loves to
            produce):
          </p>

\DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}

          >
          <p>
            This special feature currently only works with the
            <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package, not with
            <span class="texttt">pgf</span>.

          <p>
            The format <span class="texttt">.mmp</span> (Multi-MetaPost) is
            actually not a format that can be included directly in a
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
              ></span
            >-file. Rather, like a <span class="texttt">.mp</span> file, it
            first has to be converted using the MetaPost program. The crucial
            difference between <span class="texttt">.mp</span> and
            <span class="texttt">.mmp</span> is that in the latter multiple
            graphics can reside in a single
            <span class="texttt">.mmp</span> file (actually, multiple graphics
            can also reside in a <span class="texttt">.mp</span> file, but by
            convention such a file is called <span class="texttt">.mmp</span>).
            When running MetaPost on a <span class="texttt">.mmp</span> file, it
            will create not a single encapsulated PostScript file, but several,
            ending <span class="texttt">.0</span>,
            <span class="texttt">.1</span>, <span class="texttt">.2</span>, and
            so on. The idea is that <span class="texttt">.0</span> might contain
            a main graphic and the following pictures contain overlay material
            that should be incrementally added to this graphic.
          </p>
          <p>
            To include the series of resulting files, you can use the command
            <span class="texttt">\multiinclude</span> from the
            <span class="texttt">mpmulti</span> or from the
            <span class="texttt">xmpmulti</span> package. How this program works
            is explained in Section&nbsp;<a
