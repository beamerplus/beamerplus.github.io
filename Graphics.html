In the following, the advantages and disadvantages of different possible ways of creating graphics for <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span> presentations are discussed. Much of the information presented in the following is not really
special to <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>, but applies to any other document class as well.

<a id="beameruserguide-autopage-381"></a>
<p>
There are two principal ways of creating <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span>-documents that include graphics: Either the graphic resides in an external file that is <em>included</em> or the
graphic is <em>inlined</em>, which means that <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span>-file contains a bunch of commands like &ldquo;draw a red line from here to there.&rdquo; In the following, the
advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches are discussed.
</p>
<p>
You can use an external program, like <span class="texttt">xfig</span>, GIMP or Inkscape, to create a graphic. These programs have an option to <em>export</em> graphic files in a format that can then be inserted into the presentation.
</p>
<p>
The main advantage is:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>
<p>
&bull; You can use a powerful program to create a high-quality graphic.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The main disadvantages are:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>
<p>
&bull; You have to worry about many files. Typically there are at least two for each presentation, namely the program&rsquo;s graphic data file and the exported graphic file in a format that can be read by <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
&bull; Changing the graphic using the program does not automatically change the graphic in the presentation. Rather, you must reexport the graphic and rerun <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
&bull; It may be difficult to get the line width, fonts, and font sizes right.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
&bull; Creating formulas as part of graphics is often difficult or impossible.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can use all the standard <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span> commands for inserting graphics, like <span class="texttt">\includegraphics</span>. Also, the <span class="texttt">pgf</span> package offers commands for including graphics. Either will work fine in most situations, so choose whichever you like. Like <span class="texttt">\pgfdeclareimage</span>,
<span class="texttt">\includegraphics</span> also includes an image only once in a <span class="texttt">.pdf</span> file, even if it used several times (as a matter of fact, the <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package is even a bit smarter about this than
<span class="texttt">pgf</span>). However, currently only <span class="texttt">pgf</span> offers the ability to include images that are partly transparent.
</p>
<p>
At the end of this section you will find notes on how to include specific graphic formats like <span class="texttt">.eps</span> or <span class="texttt">.jpg</span>.
</p>
<p>
The commands <span class="texttt">\includegraphics</span>, <span class="texttt">\pgfuseimage</span>, and <span class="texttt">\pgfimage</span> are overlay-specification-aware in <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>. If the overlay specification does not apply, the command has no effect. This is useful for creating a simple animation where each picture of the animation resides in a different file:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">
\begin{frame}
  \includegraphics&lt;1&gt;[height=2cm]{step1.pdf}%
  \includegraphics&lt;2&gt;[height=2cm]{step2.pdf}%
  \includegraphics&lt;3&gt;[height=2cm]{step3.pdf}%
\end{frame}
</pre>
<p>
A different way of creating graphics is to insert graphic drawing commands directly into your <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span> file. There are
numerous packages that help you do this. They have various degrees of sophistication. Inlining graphics suffers from none of the disadvantages mentioned above for including external graphic files, but the main disadvantage is that it is often hard to use these packages. In
some sense, you &ldquo;program&rdquo; your graphics, which requires a bit of practice.
</p>
<p>
When choosing a graphic package, there are a few things to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>
<p>
&bull; Many packages produce poor quality graphics. This is especially true of the standard <span class="texttt">picture</span> environment of <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
&bull; Powerful packages that produce high-quality graphics often do not work together with <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>, <span class="texttt">lualatex</span> or <span class="texttt">xelatex</span>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
&bull; The most powerful and easiest-to-use package around, namely <span class="texttt">pstricks</span>, does not work together with <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>, <span class="texttt">lualatex</span> or <span class="texttt">xelatex</span> and
this is a fundamental problem. Due to the fundamental differences between <span class="pgf-name"><span class="textsc">pdf</span></span> and PostScript, it is not possible to write a &ldquo;<span class="texttt">pdflatex</span> back-end for <span class="texttt">pstricks</span>.&rdquo; (Situation with <span class="texttt">lualatex</span> and <span class="texttt">xelatex</span> is very similar.) Regardless, <span class="textsc">pst-pdf</span>, <span class="textsc">xetex-pstricks</span> and <span class="textsc">pdftricks</span> package can help here and simplify things from user&rsquo;s perspective.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are three possible solutions to the above problem, each with it&rsquo;s own advantages and disadvantages.
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>
<p>
&bull; Use the <span class="textsc">pgf</span> package. It produces high-quality graphics and works together with <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>, <span class="texttt">lualatex</span>, <span class="texttt">xelatex</span> and also with normal <span class="texttt">latex</span>. It is not as powerful as <span class="texttt">pstricks</span> (as pointed out above, this is because of rather fundamental reasons) and not as easy to use, but it should be sufficient in most cases.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
&bull; Use <span class="textsc">luamplib</span> package and <span class="texttt">lualatex</span>. It provides you with an environment using which you can type MetaPost code directly in your document.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
&bull; Use <span class="texttt">pstricks</span> and stick to <span class="texttt">latex</span> and <span class="texttt">dvips</span> or use some of the workarounds mentioned above.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="beameruserguide-autopage-383"></a>
<p>
External graphic files ending with the extension <span class="texttt">.eps</span> (Encapsulated PostScript) or <span class="texttt">.ps</span> (PostScript) can be included if you use <span class="texttt">latex</span> and <span class="texttt">dvips</span>, but <em>not</em> when using <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>. This is true both for the normal <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package and for <span class="texttt">pgf</span>. When using <span class="texttt">pgf</span>, do <em>not</em> add the extension <span class="texttt">.eps</span>. When using <span class="texttt">graphics</span>, do add the extension.
</p>
<p>
If you have a <span class="texttt">.eps</span> graphic and wish to use <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>, you can use the program <span class="texttt">ps2pdf</span> to convert the graphic to a <span class="texttt">.pdf</span> file. Some modern
distributions enable <span class="texttt">write18</span> which allows <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span> to do that automatically. Note, however, that it is often a better idea to directly generate a <span class="texttt">.pdf</span> if the program that
produced the <span class="texttt">.eps</span> supports this.
</p>

<a id="beameruserguide-autopage-384"></a>
<p>
The four formats <span class="texttt">.pdf</span>, <span class="texttt">.jpg</span>, <span class="texttt">.jpeg</span>, and <span class="texttt">.png</span> can only be included by <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>. As before, do not add these
extension when using <span class="texttt">pgf</span>, but do add them when using <span class="texttt">graphics</span>. If your graphic file has any of these formats and you wish/must use <span class="texttt">latex</span> and <span class="texttt">dvips</span>, you have to convert your graphic to <span class="texttt">.eps</span> first.

<h5 id="autosec-385"><span><span class="sectionnumber" id="sec-13.4">13.4</span> Including Graphic Files Ending <kbd>.mps</kbd></span><a class="anchor-link" href="#sec-13.4">&para;</a></h5>
<a id="beameruserguide-autopage-385"></a>
<p>
A graphic file ending <span class="texttt">.mps</span> (MetaPost PostScript) is a special kind of Encapsulated PostScript file. Files in this format are produced by the MetaPost program. As you know, <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span> is a program that converts simple plain text into beautifully typeset documents. The MetaPost program is similar, only it converts simple plain text into beautiful graphics.
</p>
<p>
The MetaPost program converts a plain text file ending <span class="texttt">.mp</span> into an <span class="texttt">.mps</span> file (although for some unfathomable reason the extension is not added). The <span class="texttt">.mp</span> file must contain
text written in the MetaFont programming language. Since <span class="texttt">.mps</span> files are actually also <span class="texttt">.eps</span> files, you can use the normal <span class="texttt">\includegraphics</span> command to include them.
</p>
<p>
However, as a special bonus, you can <em>also</em> include such a file when using <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span>. Normally, <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span> cannot handle <span class="texttt">.eps</span> files, but the <span class="texttt">.mps</span> files produced by MetaPost have such a simple and special structure that this is possible. The <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package implements some filters to convert such PostScript output to <span class="pgf-name"><span class="textsc">pdf</span></span> on-the-fly. For this to work, the file should end <span class="texttt">.mps</span> instead of <span class="texttt">.eps</span>. The following command can be used to make the <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package
just <em>assume</em> the extension <span class="texttt">.mps</span> for any file it knows nothing about (like files ending with <span class="texttt">.1</span>, which is what MetaPost loves to produce):
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">
\DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}
</pre>
<p>
This special feature currently only works with the <span class="texttt">graphics</span> package, not with <span class="texttt">pgf</span>.
</p>

<h5 id="autosec-387"><span><span class="sectionnumber" id="sec-13.5">13.5</span> Including Graphic Files Ending <kbd>.mmp</kbd></span><a class="anchor-link" href="#sec-13.5">&para;</a></h5>
<a id="beameruserguide-autopage-387"></a>
<p>
The format <span class="texttt">.mmp</span> (Multi-MetaPost) is actually not a format that can be included directly in a <span class="latexlogofont"><span class="latexlogo">T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span></span>-file. Rather, like a <span class="texttt">.mp</span> file, it first has to be converted using the MetaPost program. The crucial difference between <span class="texttt">.mp</span> and <span class="texttt">.mmp</span> is that in the latter multiple graphics can reside in a single <span class="texttt">.mmp</span> file (actually, multiple graphics can also reside in a <span class="texttt">.mp</span> file, but by convention such a file is called <span class="texttt">.mmp</span>). When running MetaPost on a <span class="texttt">.mmp</span> file,
it will create not a single encapsulated PostScript file, but several, ending <span class="texttt">.0</span>, <span class="texttt">.1</span>, <span class="texttt">.2</span>, and so on. The idea is that <span class="texttt">.0</span> might contain a main
graphic and the following pictures contain overlay material that should be incrementally added to this graphic.
</p>
<p>
To include the series of resulting files, you can use the command <span class="texttt">\multiinclude</span> from the <span class="texttt">mpmulti</span> or from the <span class="texttt">xmpmulti</span> package. How this program works is explained in
Section&nbsp;<a href="Animations-Sounds-Slide-Transitions.html#section-mpmulti">14.1.3</a>.
