            class for creating presentations that are held using a projector,
            but it can also be used to create transparency slides. Preparing
            presentations with
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            is different from preparing them with

            Libre-/OpenOffice.org Impress, Apple Keynote, Calligra Stage or
            Microsoft PowerPoint. A

            <span class="texttt">\subsection</span>s, the different slides

            <span class="texttt">itemize</span> and
            <span class="texttt">enumerate</span> environments, and so on. The
            obvious disadvantage of this approach is that you have to know

            in order to use
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span

                have to worry about which version of the presentation program
                might be installed there. Also, your presentation is going to
                look exactly the way it looked on your computer.

            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            mainly in his spare time. Many other people have helped by sending
            him emails containing suggestions for improvement or corrections or
            patches or whole new themes (by now, this amounts to over a thousand
            emails concerning
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >). Indeed, most of the development was only initiated by feature
            requests and bug reports. Without this feedback,
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            would still be what it was originally intended to be: a small
            private collection of macros that make using the
            <span class="texttt">seminar</span> class easier. Till created the
            first version of
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            for his PhD defense presentation in February 2003. A month later, he
            put the package on <span class="textsc">ctan</span> at the request
            of some colleagues. After that, things somehow got out of hand.

            After being unmaintained since 2007, in April 2010 Till handed over
            the maintenance to Joseph Wright and Vedran Miletić, who are still
            maintaining it: improving code, fixing bugs, adding new features and
            helping users.

              >&rsquo;s development depends not only on me, but on the feedback
              I get from other people. Many features have been implemented
              because someone requested them and I thought that these features
              would be nice to have and reasonably easy to implement. Other
              people have given valuable feedback on themes, on the user&rsquo;s
              guide, on features of the class, on the internals of the
              implementation, on special

          <a id="beameruserguide-autopage-11"></a>
          <p>
            You should start with the first part. If you have not yet installed
            the package, please read Section&nbsp;<a
              href="Installation.html#section-installation"
              >2</a
            >
            first. If you are new to
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >, you should next read the tutorial in Section&nbsp;<a
              href="Tutorial-Euclid-Presentation.html#section-tutorial"
              >3</a
            >. When you sit down to create your first real presentation using
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >, read Section&nbsp;<a
              href="Workflow-For-Creating-Beamer-Presentation.html#section-workflow"
              >4</a
            >
            where the technical details of a possible workflow are discussed. If
            you are still new to creating presentations in general, you might
            find Section&nbsp;<a
              href="Guidelines-Creating-Presentations.html#section-guidelines"
              >5</a
            >
            helpful, where many guidelines are given on what to do and what not
            to do. Finally, you should browse through Section&nbsp;<a
              href="Solution-Templates.html#section-solutions"
              >6</a
            >, where you will find ready-to-use solution templates for creating
            talks, possibly even in the language you intend to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part of this user&rsquo;s guide goes into the details of
            all the commands defined in
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >, but it also addresses other technical issues having to do with
            creating presentations (like how to include graphics or animations).
          </p>
          <p>
            The third part explains how you can change the appearance of your
            presentation easily either using themes or by specifying colors or
            fonts for specific elements of a presentation (like, say, the font
            used for the numbers in an enumeration).
          </p>
          <p>
            The fourth part talks about handouts and lecture notes, so called
            &ldquo;support material&rdquo;. You will frequently have create some
            kind of support material to give to your audience during the talk or
            after it, and this part will explain how to do it using the same
            source that you created your presentation from.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last part contains &ldquo;howtos,&rdquo; which are explanations
            of how to get certain things done using
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >.

            This user&rsquo;s guide contains descriptions of all
            &ldquo;public&rdquo; commands, environments, and concepts defined by
            the
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >-class. The following examples show how things are documented. As a
            general rule, red text is <em>defined</em>, green text is
            <em>optional</em>, blue text indicates special mode considerations.

              <span class="texttt">\somebeamercommand</span> does. The green
              argument(s) is optional. The command of this example takes two

              Here you will find an explanation of the template, color, and/or
              font <span class="texttt">some beamer element</span>. A
              &ldquo;<span class="beamer-name"
                ><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
              >-element&rdquo; is a concept that is explained in more detail in
              Section&nbsp;<a
                href="Inner-Themes-Outer-Themes-Templates.html#section-elements"
                >16</a
              >. Roughly speaking, an <em>element</em> is a part of a
              presentation that is potentially typeset in some special way.
              Examples of elements are frame titles, the author&rsquo;s name, or
              the footnote sign. For most elements there exists a
              <em>template</em>, see Section&nbsp;<a
                href="Inner-Themes-Outer-Themes-Templates.html#section-elements"
                >16</a
              >
              once more, and also a
              <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
              >-color and a
              <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
              >-font.
            </p>
            <p>
              For each element, it is indicated whether a template, a
              <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
              >-color, and/or a
              <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
              >-font of the name
              <span class="texttt">some beamer element</span> exist. Typically,
              all three exist and are employed together when the element needs
              to be typeset, that is, when the template is inserted the
              <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
              >-color and -font are installed first. However, sometimes
              templates do not have a color or font associated with them (like
              parent templates). Also, there exist
              <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
              >-colors and -fonts that do not have an underlying template.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using and changing templates is explained in Section&nbsp;<a
                href="Inner-Themes-Outer-Themes-Templates.html#section-templates"
                >16.3</a
              >. Here is the essence: To change a template, you can say
            </p>
            <pre class="verbatim">
\setbeamertemplate{some beamer element}{your definition for this template}
</pre
            >
            <p>
              Unfortunately, it is not quite trivial to come up with a good
              definition for some templates. Fortunately, there are often
              <em>predefined options</em> for a template. These are indicated
              like this:
            </p>

            <p>
              &bull;
              <span class="itemoption"
                ><kbd>[<span class="declare">rose</span>]</kbd></span
              >
              causes a rose be used to render the template.
            </p>

            <p>
              &bull;
              <span class="itemoption"
                ><kbd>[<span class="declare">shamrock</span>]</kbd>{<span
                  class="meta"
                  ><span class="angle">&langle;</span><i>number of leaves</i
                  ><span class="angle">&rangle;</span></span
                >}</span
              >
              causes a shamrock with a given number of leaves to be used to
              render the template.
            </p>

            <p>You can install such a predefined option like this:</p>
            <pre class="verbatim">
\setbeamertemplate{some beamer element}[rose]
%% Now a rose is used

\setbeamertemplate{some beamer element}[shamrock]{3}
%% Now a shamrock is used
</pre
            >
            <p>
              Note that not all templates have predefined options and that not
              all templates with predefined options allow an additional
              argument.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
              >-colors are explained in Section&nbsp;<a
                href="Colors.html#section-colors"
                >17</a
              >. Here is the essence: To change the foreground of the color to,
              say, red, use
            </p>
            <pre class="verbatim">
\setbeamercolor{some beamer element}{fg=red}
</pre
            >
            <p>To change the background to, say, black, use:</p>
            <pre class="verbatim">
\setbeamercolor{some beamer element}{bg=black}
</pre
            >
            <p>
              You can also change them together using
              <span class="texttt">fg=red,bg=black</span>. The background will
              not always be &ldquo;honoured,&rdquo; since it is difficult to
              show a colored background correctly and an extra effort must be
              made by the templates (while the foreground color is usually used
              automatically).

                >18</a

              In addition to the size, you can use things like
              <span class="texttt">series=\bfseries</span> to set the series,
              <span class="texttt">shape=\itshape</span> to change the shape,
              <span class="texttt">family=\sffamily</span> to change the family,
              and you can use them in conjunction. Add a star to the command to
              first &ldquo;reset&rdquo; the font.

            As next to this paragraph, you will sometimes find the word
            <span class="textsc">presentation</span> in blue next to some
            paragraph. This means that the paragraph applies only when you
            &ldquo;normally typeset your presentation using
            <span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"
                  >e</span
                >X</span
              ></span
            >
            or pdf<span class="latexlogofont"
              ><span class="latexlogo"
                >L<span class="latexlogosup">a</span>T<span class="latexlogosub"
                  >e</span
                >X</span
              ></span
            >.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Opposed to this, a paragraph with
            <span class="textsc">article</span> next to it describes some
            behavior that is special for the
            <span class="texttt">article</span> mode. This special mode is used
            to create lecture notes out of a presentation (the two can coexist
            in one file).

                4. Before you file a bug report, especially a bug report
                concerning the installation, make sure that this is really a
                bug. In particular, have a look at the
                <span class="texttt">.log</span> file that results when you
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
                  ></span
                >
                your files. This <span class="texttt">.log</span> file should
                show that all the right files are loaded from the right
                directories. Nearly all installation problems can be resolved by
                looking at the <span class="texttt">.log</span> file.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you can, before reporting the bug, retest using latest
                version of
                <span class="beamer-name"
                  ><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
                >
                with latest version of
                <span class="latexlogofont"
                  ><span class="latexlogo"
                    >T<span class="latexlogosub">e</span>X</span
                  ></span
                >
                Live. This can help isolate bugs from other packages that might
                affect
                <span class="beamer-name"
                  ><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
                >.

                5. <em>As a last resort</em> you can try emailing authors. We do
                not mind getting emails, we simply get way too many of them.
                Because of this, we cannot guarantee that your emails will be
                answered timely or even at all. Reporting an issue is usually a
                better approach as they don&rsquo;t get lost.
