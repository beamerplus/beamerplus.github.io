            We wish to help Prof. Euclid of the University of Alexandria to
            create a presentation on his latest discovery: There are infinitely
            many prime numbers! Euclid wrote a paper on this and it got accepted
            at the 27th International Symposium on Prime Numbers

            (ISPN&nbsp;&rsquo;80). Euclid wishes to use the
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            class to create a presentation for the conference. On the conference
            webpage he found out that he will have twenty minutes for his talk,
            including questions.

          <a id="beameruserguide-autopage-48"></a>
          <p>
            The first thing Euclid should do is to look for a solution template
            for his presentation. Having a look at Section&nbsp;<a
              href="Solution-Templates.html#section-solutions"
              >6</a
            >, he finds that the file
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
beamer/doc/solutions/conference-talks/conference-ornate-20min.en.tex
</pre
          >
          <p>
            might be appropriate. He creates a subdirectory
            <span class="texttt">presentation</span> in the directory that
            contains the actual paper and copies the solution template to this
            subdirectory, renaming to <span class="texttt">main.tex</span>.
          </p>
          <p>He opens the file in his favorite editor. It starts</p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\documentclass{beamer}
</pre
          >
          <p>which Euclid finds hardly surprising. Next comes a line reading</p>
          <div class="fancyvrb" style>
            <pre class="verbatim">
\mode&lt;presentation&gt;
</pre
            >
          </div>
          <p>
            which Euclid does not understand. Since he finds more stuff in the
            file that he does not understand, he decides to ignore all of that
            for time being, hoping that it all serves some good purpose.
          </p>

          <h5 id="autosec-52">

          <a id="beameruserguide-autopage-52"></a>
          <p>
            The next thing that seems logical is the place where the
            <span class="texttt">\title</span> command is used. Naturally, he
            replaces it with
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\title{There Is No Largest Prime Number}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            since this was the title of the paper. He sees that the command
            <span class="texttt">\title</span> also takes an optional
            &ldquo;short&rdquo; argument in square brackets, which is shown in
            places where there is little space, but he decides that the title is
            short enough by itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Euclid next adjusts the <span class="texttt">\author</span> and
            <span class="texttt">\date</span> fields as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
%\author{Euclid of Alexandria}
%\date[ISPN '80]{27th International Symposium of Prime Numbers}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            For the date, he felt that the name was a little long, so a short
            version is given (<span class="texttt">ISPN &rsquo;80</span>). On
            second thought, Euclid decides to add his email address and replaces
            the <span class="texttt">\author</span> field as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
%\author[Euclid]{Euclid of Alexandria \\ \texttt{euclid@alexandria.edu}}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            Somehow Euclid does not like the fact that there is no &ldquo;<span
              class="texttt"
              >\email</span
            >&rdquo; command in
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >. He decides to write an email to
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >&rsquo;s author, asking him to fix this, but postpones this for
            later when the presentation is finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two fields that Euclid does not know, but whose meaning he
            can guess: <span class="texttt">\subtitle</span> and
            <span class="texttt">\institute</span>. He adjusts them. (Euclid
            does not need to use the <span class="texttt">\and</span> command,
            which is used to separate several authors, nor the
            <span class="texttt">\inst</span> command, which just makes its
            argument a superscript).

            The next thing in the file that seems interesting is where the first
            &ldquo;frame&rdquo; is created, right after the
            <span class="texttt">\</span
            ><span class="texttt">begin{document}</span>:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">

            In
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >, a presentation consists of a series of frames. Each frame in turn
            may consist of several slides (if there is more than one, they are
            called overlays). Normally, everything between
            <span class="texttt">\begin{frame}</span> and
            <span class="texttt">\end{frame}</span> is put on a single slide. No
            page breaking is performed. So Euclid infers that the first frame is
            &ldquo;filled&rdquo; by the title page, which seems quite logical.

            Eager to find out how the first page will look, he invokes
            <span class="texttt">pdflatex</span> on his file
            <span class="texttt">main.tex</span> (twice). He could also use
            <span class="texttt">latex</span> (twice), followed by
            <span class="texttt">dvips</span>, and then possibly
            <span class="texttt">ps2pdf</span>, or
            <span class="texttt">lualatex</span> (twice), or
            <span class="texttt">xelatex</span> (twice). Then he uses the
            Acrobat Reader, <span class="texttt">xpdf</span>,
            <span class="texttt">evince</span> or
            <span class="texttt">okular</span> to view the resulting
            <span class="texttt">main.pdf</span>. Indeed, the first page
            contains all the information Euclid has provided until now. It even
            looks quite impressive with the colorful title and the rounded
            corners and the shadows, but he is doubtful whether he should leave
            it like that. He decides to address this problem later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Euclid is delighted to find out that clicking on a section or
            subsection in the navigation bar at the top hyperjumps there. Also,
            the small symbols at the bottom seem to be clickable. Toying around
            with them for a while, he finds that clicking on the arrows left or
            right of a symbol hyperjumps him backward or forward one

          <p>
            These commands are given <em>outside</em> of frames. So Euclid
            assumes that at the point of invocation they have no direct effect,
            they only create entries in the table of contents. Having a
            &ldquo;Motivation&rdquo; section seems reasonable to Euclid, but he
            changes the <span class="texttt">\subsection</span> title.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he looks at the presentation, he notices that his assumption was
            not quite true: each <span class="texttt">\subsection</span> command
            seems to insert a frame containing a table of contents into the
            presentation. Doubling back he finds the command that causes this:
            The <span class="texttt">\AtBeginSubsection</span> inserts a frame
            with only the current subsection highlighted at the beginning of
            each section. If Euclid does not like this, he can just delete the
            whole <span class="texttt">\AtBeginSubsection</span> stuff and the
            table of contents at the beginning of each subsection disappears.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="texttt">\section</span> and
            <span class="texttt">\subsection</span> commands take optional short
            arguments. These short arguments are used whenever a short form of
            the section of subsection name is needed. While this is in keeping
            with the way
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            treats the optional arguments of things like
            <span class="texttt">\title</span>, it is <em>different</em> from
            the usual way

              ></span
            >
            treats an optional argument for sections (where the optional
            argument dictates what is shown in the table of contents and the
            main argument dictates what is shown everywhere else; in
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            things are exactly the other way round).

            Euclid then modifies the next frame, which is the first
            &ldquo;real&rdquo; frame of the presentation, as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What Are Prime Numbers?}
  A prime number is a number that has exactly two divisors.
\end{frame}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            This yields the desired result. It might be a good idea to put some
            emphasis on the object being defined (prime numbers). Euclid tries
            <span class="texttt">\emph</span> but finds that too mild an
            emphasis.
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            offers the command <span class="texttt">\alert</span>, which is used
            like <span class="texttt">\emph</span> and, by default, typesets its
            argument in bright red.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, Euclid decides to make it even clearer that he is giving a
            definition by putting a
            <span class="texttt">definition</span> environment around the
            definition.
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">

          <p>
            Other useful environments like <span class="texttt">theorem</span>,

            <span class="texttt">proof</span>,
            <span class="texttt">corollary</span>, or
            <span class="texttt">example</span> are also predefined by
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >. As in <span class="texttt">amsmath</span>, they take optional
            arguments that they show in brackets. Indeed,
            <span class="texttt">amsmath</span> is automatically loaded by
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it is always a good idea to add examples, Euclid decides to
            add one:

          <pre class="verbatim">

          <p>
            The frame already looks quite nice, though, perhaps a bit colorful.
            However, Euclid would now like to show the three items one after
            another, not all three right away. To achieve this, he adds
            <span class="texttt">\pause</span> commands after the first and
            second items:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
 \begin{itemize}
 \item 2 is prime (two divisors: 1 and 2).
   \pause
 \item 3 is prime (two divisors: 1 and 3).
   \pause
 \item 4 is not prime (\alert{three} divisors: 1, 2, and 4).
 \end{itemize}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            By showing them incrementally, he hopes to focus the
            audience&rsquo;s attention on the item he is currently talking
            about. On second thought, he deletes the
            <span class="texttt">\pause</span> stuff once more since in simple
            cases like the above the pausing is rather silly. Indeed, Euclid has
            noticed that good presentations make use of this uncovering
            mechanism only in special circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Euclid finds that he can also add a
            <span class="texttt">\pause</span> between the definition and the
            example. So, <span class="texttt">\pause</span>s seem to transcend
            environments, which Euclid finds quite useful. After some
            experimentation he finds that
            <span class="texttt">\pause</span> only does not work in
            <span class="texttt">align</span> environments. He immediately
            writes an email about this to
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >&rsquo;s author, but receives a polite answer stating that the
            implementation of <span class="texttt">align</span> does wicked
            things and there is no fix for this. Also, Euclid is pointed to the
            last part of the user&rsquo;s guide, where a workaround is
            described.

            The next frame is to show his main argument and is put in a
            &ldquo;Results&rdquo; section. Euclid desires a more complicated
            overlay behavior for this frame: In an enumeration of four points he
            wishes to uncover the points one-by-one, but he wishes the fourth
            point to be shown at the same time as the first. The idea is to
            illustrate his new proof method, namely proof by contradiction,
            where a wrong assumption is brought to a contradiction at the end
            after a number of intermediate steps that are not important at the
            beginning. For this, Euclid uses
            <em>overlay specifications</em>:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{There Is No Largest Prime Number}
  \framesubtitle{The proof uses \textit{reductio ad absurdum}.}

  \begin{theorem}
    There is no largest prime number.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item&lt;1-&gt; Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number.
    \item&lt;2-&gt; Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers.
    \item&lt;3-&gt; Then $q + 1$ is not divisible by any of them.
    \item&lt;1-&gt; But $q + 1$ is greater than $1$, thus divisible by some prime
      number not in the first $p$ numbers.\qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}
  \uncover&lt;4-&gt;{The proof used \textit{reductio ad absurdum}.}
\end{frame}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            The overlay specifications are given in pointed brackets. The
            specification <span class="texttt">&lt;1-&gt;</span> means
            &ldquo;from slide 1 on.&rdquo; Thus, the first and fourth item are
            shown on the first slide of the frame, but the other two items are
            not shown. Rather, the second point is shown only from the second
            slide onward.
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            automatically computes the number of slides needed for each frame.
            More generally, overlay specification are lists of numbers or number
            ranges where the start or ending of a range can be left open. For
            example <span class="texttt">-3,5-6,8-</span> means &ldquo;on all
            slides, except for slides 4 and&nbsp;7.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="texttt">\qedhere</span> is used to put the
            <span class="textsc">qed</span> symbol at the end of the line
            <em>inside</em> the enumeration. Normally, the
            <span class="textsc">qed</span> symbol is automatically inserted at
            the end of a proof environment, but that would be on an ugly empty
            line here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="texttt">\item</span> command is not the only
            command that takes overlay specifications. Another useful command
            that takes one is the <span class="texttt">\uncover</span> command.
            It only shows its argument on the slides specified in the overlay
            specification. On all other slides, the argument is hidden (though
            it still occupies space). The command
            <span class="texttt">\only</span> is similar and Euclid could also
            have tried
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
 \only&lt;4-&gt;{The proof used \textit{reductio ad absurdum}.}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            On non-specified slides the
            <span class="texttt">\only</span> command simply &ldquo;throws its
            argument away&rdquo; and the argument does not occupy any space.
            This leads to different heights of the text on the first three
            slides and on the fourth slide. If the text is centered vertically,
            this will cause the text to &ldquo;wobble&rdquo; and thus
            <span class="texttt">\uncover</span> should be used. However, you
            sometimes wish things to &ldquo;really disappear&rdquo; on some
            slides and then <span class="texttt">\only</span> is useful. Euclid
            could also have used the class option <span class="texttt">t</span>,
            which causes the text in frames to be vertically flushed to the top.
            Then a differing text height does not cause wobbling. Vertical
            flushing can also be achieved for only a single frame by giving the
            optional argument <span class="texttt">[t]</span> like this to the
            <span class="texttt">frame</span> environment as in
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{There Is No Largest Prime Number}
  ...
\end{frame}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            Vice versa, if the <span class="texttt">t</span> class option is
            given, a frame can be vertically centered using the
            <span class="texttt">[c]</span> option for the frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            It turns out that certain environments, including the
            <span class="texttt">theorem</span> and
            <span class="texttt">proof</span> environments above, also take
            overlay specifications. If such a specification is given, the whole
            theorem or proof is only shown on the specified slides.

            On the next frame, Euclid wishes to contrast solved and open

            problem&rdquo; environment similar to the
            <span class="texttt">theorem</span> environment, Euclid decides to
            use the <span class="texttt">block</span>
            environment, which allows him to give an arbitrary title:

          <p>
            He could also have defined his own theorem-like environment by

            The optional argument <span class="texttt">[theorem]</span> ensures
            that these environments are numbered the same way as everything
            else. Since these numbers are not shown anyway, it does not really
            matter whether they are given, but it&rsquo;s a good practice and,
            perhaps, Euclid might need these numbers some other time.

            and the &ldquo;Open Questions&rdquo; on the right, so as to create a
            stronger visual contrast. For this, he uses the
            <span class="texttt">columns</span> environment. Inside this
            environment, <span class="texttt">\column</span> commands create new
            columns.
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">

            Trying this, he is not quite satisfied with the result as the block
            on the left has a different height than the one on the right. He
            thinks it would be nicer if they were vertically top-aligned. So he
            adds the <span class="texttt">[t]</span> option to the
            <span class="texttt">columns</span> environment.
          </p>

            Euclid is somewhat pleased to find out that a
            <span class="texttt">\pause</span> at the end of the first column
            allows him to &ldquo;uncover&rdquo; the second column only on the
            second slide of the frame.

            Euclid decides that he would like to add a citation to his open
            questions list, since he would like to attribute the question to his
            good old friend Christian. Euclid is not really sure whether using a
            bibliography in his talk is a good idea, but he goes ahead anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            To this end, he adds an entry to the bibliography, which he
            fortunately already finds in the solution file. Having the
            bibliography in the appendix does not quite suit Euclid, so he
            removes the <span class="texttt">\appendix</span> command. He also
            notices
            <span class="texttt"><presentation></presentation></span> overlay
            specifications and finds them a bit strange, but they don&rsquo;t
            seem to hurt either. Hopefully they do something useful. His
            bibliography looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
 \begin{thebibliography}{10}

            On another frame, Euclid would like to show a listing of an
            algorithm his friend Eratosthenes has sent him (saying he came up
            with it while reorganizing his sieve collection). Euclid normally
            uses the <span class="texttt">verbatim</span> environment and
            sometimes also similar environments like
            <span class="texttt">lstlisting</span> to typeset listings. He can
            also use them in
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >, but he must add the <span class="texttt">fragile</span> option to
            the frame:
          </p>
          <div class="fancyvrb" style>

     {
       std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; " ";

          <p>
            On second thought, Euclid would prefer to uncover part of the
            algorithm stepwise and to add an emphasis on certain lines or parts
            of lines. He can use package like
            <span class="texttt">alltt</span> for this, but in simple cases the
            environment <span class="texttt">{semiverbatim}</span> defined by
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            is more useful: It works like
            <span class="texttt">{verbatim}</span>, except that
            <span class="texttt">\</span>, <span class="texttt">{</span>, and
            <span class="texttt">}</span> retain their meaning (one can typeset
            them by using <span class="texttt">\\</span>,
            <span class="texttt">\{</span>, and <span class="texttt">\}</span>).
            Euclid might now typeset his algorithm as follows:
          </p>
          <div class="fancyvrb" style>
            <pre class="verbatim">

            The <span class="texttt">\visible</span> command does nearly the
            same as <span class="texttt">\uncover</span>. However one difference
            occurs if the command
            <span class="texttt">\setbeamercovered{transparent}</span> has been
            used to make covered text &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; instead,
            <span class="texttt">\visible</span> still makes the text completely
            &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; on non-specified slides. Euclid has the
            feeling that the naming convention is a bit strange, but cannot
            quite pinpoint the problem.

            With the contents of this talk fixed, Euclid decides to have a
            second look at the way things look. He goes back to the beginning
            and finds the line
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\usetheme{Warsaw}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            By substituting other cities (he notices that these cities seem to
            have in common that there has been a workshop or conference on
            theoretical computer science there at which always the same person
            had a paper, attended, or gave a talk) Euclid can change the way his
            presentation is going to look. He decides to choose some theme that
            is reasonably simple but, since his talk is not too short, shows a
            bit of navigational information.
          </p>
          <p>
            He settles on the <span class="texttt">Frankfurt</span> theme but
            decides that the light-dark contrast is too strong. He adds
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">

          <p>The result seems some more subdued to him.</p>
          <p>
            Euclid decides that the font used for the titles is not quite
            classical enough (classical fonts are the latest chic in
            Alexandria). So, he adds
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\usefonttheme[onlylarge]{structuresmallcapsserif}

          >
          <p>
            Euclid notices that the small fonts in the navigation bars are a bit
            hard to read as they are so thin. Adding the following helps:

          <p>
            Since Euclid wants to give a <em>perfect</em> talk, he decides that
            the font used for the title simply has to be a serif italics. To
            change only the font used for the title, Euclid uses the following
            command:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\setbeamerfont{title}{shape=\itshape,family=\rmfamily}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            He notices that the font is still quite large (which he likes), but
            wonders why this is the case since he did not specify this. The
            reason is that calls of
            <span class="texttt">\setbeamerfont</span> accumulate and the size
            was already set to <span class="texttt">\large</span> by some font
            theme. Using the starred version of
            <span class="texttt">\setbeamerfont</span> &ldquo;resets&rdquo; the
            font.
          </p>
          <p>
            Euclid decides that he would also like to change the color of the
            title to a dashing red, though, perhaps, with a bit of black added.
            He uses the following command:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\setbeamercolor{title}{fg=red!80!black}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            Trying the following command, Euclid is delighted to find that
            specifying a background color also has an effect:
          </p>
          <pre class="verbatim">
\setbeamercolor{title}{fg=red!80!black,bg=red!20!white}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            Finally, Euclid is satisfied with the presentation and goes ahead
            and gives a great talk at the conference, making many new friends.
            He also writes that email to
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >&rsquo;s author containing that long list of things that he missed
            in
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span>
            or that do not work. He is a bit disappointed to learn that it might
            take till ISPN&nbsp;&rsquo;79 for all these things to be taken care
            of, but he also understands that
            <span class="beamer-name"><span class="textsc">beamer</span></span
            >&rsquo;s authors also need some time to do research or otherwise he
            would have nothing to give presentations about.
